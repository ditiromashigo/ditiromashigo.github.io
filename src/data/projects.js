    description: `In 2022 Ditiro Mashigo began working on something that was deeply meditative, driven by her desire to explore the connections and conventions that were passed down via matrilineality. Both rope-like and organic in form, the resulting artwork is titled <em>Kala</em>, a word that means tree stem, and also refers to kalana which is the Sotho word for the umbilical cord. <em>Kala</em>, which the artist has worked on intermittently for two years, is composed primarily of clothing: her own, some of it manufacturing waste and some sourced from the fashion industry. Mashigo’s work – both ready-to-wear and not – has integrated upcycling offcuts from the fast-fashion industry, engendering a beautiful and sustainable practice. She skillfully combines and fuses these discarded, personal and often undervalued items, tracking back in a meditative spirit the paths and connections that bind her and her maternal lineage. The long cord of <em>Kala</em> has no beginning and no certain end, it winds and overlaps and gently enmeshes itself within itself as well as the space it occupies. It is an extraordinary visual representation of the ancient connections women hold within them, that they will pass down and put out into the world in one way or another.`,

    description: `Ditiro Mashigo’s textile installation titled Kano formed part of her exhibition titled <em>7.7.7.7 / X9 /  ‘Ma Zith iingqondo zethu, / Zimbonge uYehova; / Kuba iinceba zakhe, / Zimi ngonaphakade</em>, which took place at Keyes Art Mile in Johannesburg in 2023 as part of INCCA’s Art After Baby initiative . “Mashigo views her practice as a hybrid between fashion and art,” wrote Christa Dee about the body of work, “with the skills from each half creating a wonderfully vibrant middle ground. The exhibition resulting from the project Art After Baby, sees these two worlds meet for the first time in an exhibition format. This marks a significant moment in Mashigo’s career and evolution in her modes of making. Showcasing new fibre art and monotypes, this presentation articulates an accumulation of thematic references – a powerful female familial lineage, embracing domestic spaces, her ongoing spiritual journey and her Pedi culture.”`,

    description:
      `<em> IZulu iKaya lami | The heavens are my home — a Zulu chorus</em> was created from a place of counter-seeing and feeling, it challenges the conventional notion of the sky as merely blue and home as a place outside the body. "This exploration stems from childhood memory, where I was enchanted by fairy tales of dames, damsels, and dragons and where I first experienced the feeling of being displaced, after relocating from Lebowakgomo to Pretoria. I recall needing to feel at home in a land foreign to me, the memory of finding solace in these stories sparked an understanding of how imagination shapes our world, leading me to retell them from an African perspective. I realign these tales with my version of beauty, my understanding of the divine, and the sources of my inspiration which are usually formless but are rather textured in language and colour."`,

    writes Christa Dee</a>, “speak to the fragility of life and the permanence of mark-making. The addition of embroidery to her prints – thinking about the action of piercing the surface and moving thread through this opening – brings viewers’ attention to Mashigo’s reflections on the spiritual realm. Her works are often made while listening to praise music, channelling this sonic influence and her own long-term personal divine journey. The prints are also the result of her realisation over time that some of what she wants to create can also exist on flat surfaces like paper.”`,

    description: `Serati Ltd is Ditiro Mashigo's slow fashion label. Named after her middle name, meaning “prayers” in Sepedi, Serati is rooted in Mashigo’s desire to make clothing that honours both personal and planetary healing. The label embraces natural fibres, botanical dyeing, and artisanal techniques as a way to reconnect with indigenous knowledge systems and honour the environment. Each collection is shaped by dreams and ancestral intuition – like the vision that led her to create a kimono inspired by a memory of her late grandmother. In 2019, Mashigo was commissioned to design costumes for the Grammy Award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir, a milestone project for which she employed over 15 women, reinforcing her commitment to community empowerment. She later collaborated with Mr. Price Home on a signature homeware collection, expanding Serati’s creative vision into the domestic realm. Based in Limpopo and working closely with local artisans, Mashigo sees Serati not only as a fashion label, but as a form of storytelling – where garments become vessels of spirit, soil, and identity.

    Serati, <a href="https://incca.org.za/Feature-Threaded-histories-and-spiritual-tactility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    writes Christa Dee</a>, is for what the artist describes as "'a majestic woman who resembles everything and anything that is African and beautiful.' This is also a vision of the woman she wants to embody through her life and her artistic outputs. 'I look at women as sort of these angelic beings,' Mashigo continues, 'Women pray, women feed and nurture, women create spaces of worship, women create environments that are enabling for growth and that is sacred work to me. Even when I have my eyes closed and I think of something to create, I always go right back to the sacred space that women occupy in our lives and in their own lives. I always want to celebrate that.'"

    writes Christa Dee</a>, “presents shades of green, deep reds and yellows knotted and woven together with thin plastic tubing of the same tones. In this way, viewers can experience an exploration of materiality and weaving techniques, producing a beautifully unkempt textured piece that invites the impulse to run one’s fingers over it. Here, textile-making can be read as a metaphor for the flexibility of the human spirit, the strength of women-led domestic practices and a visual representation of how memories are passed on through generations – core inquiries in Mashigo’s work.”`,
