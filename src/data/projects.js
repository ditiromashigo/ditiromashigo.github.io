      description: "In 2022 Ditiro Mashigo began working on something that was deeply meditative, driven by her desire to explore the connections and conventions that were passed down via matrilineality. Both rope-like and organic in form, the resulting artwork is titled Kala, a word that means tree stem, and also refers to kalana which is the Sotho word for the umbilical cord. Kala, which the artist has worked on intermittently for two years, is composed primarily of clothing: her own, some of it manufacturing waste and some sourced from the fashion industry.  Mashigo’s work – both ready-to-wear and not – has integrated upcycling offcuts from the fast-fashion industry, engendering a beautiful and sustainable practice. She skillfully combines and fuses these discarded, personal and often undervalued items, tracking back in a meditative spirit the paths and connections that bind her and her maternal lineage. The long cord of Kala has no beginning and no certain end, it winds and overlaps and gently enmeshes itself within itself as well as the space it occupies. It is an extraordinary visual representation of the ancient connections women hold within them, that they will pass down and put out into the world in one way or another.",

      description: "Ditiro Mashigo’s textile installation titled Kano formed part of her exhibition titled 7.7.7.7 / X9 /  ‘Ma Zith iingqondo zethu, / Zimbonge uYehova; / Kuba iinceba zakhe, / Zimi ngonaphakade, which took place at Keyes Art Mile in Johannesburg in 2023 as part of INCCA’s Art After Baby initiative . “Mashigo views her practice as a hybrid between fashion and art,” wrote Christa Dee about the body of work, “with the skills from each half creating a wonderfully vibrant middle ground. The exhibition resulting from the project Art After Baby, sees these two worlds meet for the first time in an exhibition format. This marks a significant moment in Mashigo’s career and evolution in her modes of making. Showcasing new fibre art and monotypes, this presentation articulates an accumulation of thematic references – a powerful female familial lineage, embracing domestic spaces, her ongoing spiritual journey and her Pedi culture.”",

      description: "IZulu iKaya lami | The heavens are my home — a Zulu chorus — embodies the essence of this body of work. Created from a place of counter-seeing and feeling, it challenges the conventional notion of the sky as merely blue and home as a place outside the body.'This exploration stems from childhood memory, where I was enchanted by fairy tales of dames, damsels, and dragons and where I first experienced the feeling of being displaced, after relocating from Lebowakgomo to Pretoria. I recall needing to feel at home in a land foreign to me, the memory of finding solace in these stories sparked an understanding of how imagination shapes our world, leading me to retell them from an African perspective. I realign these tales with my version of beauty, my understanding of the divine, and the sources of my inspiration which are usually formless but are rather textured in language and color.",
